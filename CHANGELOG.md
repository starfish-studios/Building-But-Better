# CHANGELOG
- ### There's a config now !!
- ### Urns can now be interacted with Dirt -- when they are filled in this way, plants can be placed atop them.
  - To remove the Dirt, simply right-click the Urn with any Shovel -- this uses the #minecraft:shovels tag, so any item tagged as a Shovel will work. 
  - Urns utilize Supplementaries' "prevents_offset_above" tag, so when using Supplementaries, plants will not have a random offset when placed inside of Urns. This prevents them from being placed on the edges of the Urn.
- ### Stone Frames + Frame Tweaks
 - ***Frames should no longer crash when connected to a non-solid block!***
  - Frames now have custom hitboxes, and can be interacted through. Their more precise hitboxes will be replaced with a larger hitbox when holding Hammers or Frames or crouching. 
    - **There is a config available to change these hitboxes to always be visible or to not get show at all when crouching.**
    - Frame tooltips also change depending on which config option you have enabled!
  - Stone Frames act the same as normal wooden Frames -- the only differences are their materials and styles.
  - Frames now have custom sizing when placed in Item Frames, allowing them to encompass the Item Frame _(but with a different shape)_, allowing for further Frame customization and build opportunities.
  - Wooden Frames and stone Frames alike no longer have an odd pixel gap when placed on corners. The corner gap fills -- this is a simple model change.
  - Frames no longer have z-fighting when customized with Debug Sticks or placed on opposing corners.
- ### Added Balustrades
  - Balustrades replace the functionality of placing Trapdoors on top of Lecterns, but in all wood types.
  - Balustrades can be interacted with a Hammer on either their top or bottom half to toggle the top and bottom respectively. Their center beam cannot be toggled, and uses the texture of Wooden Walls / Beams so they can better connect with them.
  - Balustrades can be **SHIFT** + right-clicked with a Hammer to tilt the top cube to represent a slightly taller Lectern. Doing so will give them a custom hitbox, but they will act the same otherwise.
